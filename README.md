# 📥 Outlook SOC CSV Downloader

This PowerShell script automatically downloads **CSV attachments** from a shared Outlook mailbox.  
It was designed to handle a SOC workflow where daily reports are sent *on behalf of* `NT SOC MOT-IL`.

---

## ✨ Features
- Connects to a **shared mailbox** in Outlook (`SOC` in this example).
- Filters incoming emails by **sender / on behalf of** (e.g. `NT SOC MOT-IL`).
- Downloads **only `.csv` attachments**.
- Restricts downloads to **today’s date only** – ensures you only process fresh reports.
- Keeps a local state file to **avoid duplicates** across runs.
- Logs every run (`download_log.txt`) for auditing.
